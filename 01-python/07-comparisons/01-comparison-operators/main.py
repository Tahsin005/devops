"""Comparison Operators
When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. Boolean logic is the name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in True or False.

The operators:

< "less than"
> "greater than"
<= "less than or equal to"
>= "greater than or equal to"
== "equal to"
!= "not equal to"
For example:

5 < 6 # evaluates to True
5 > 6 # evaluates to False
5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
5 == 6 # evaluates to False
5 != 6 # evaluates to True
