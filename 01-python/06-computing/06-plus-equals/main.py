Plus Equals
Python makes reassignment easy when doing math. In JavaScript or Go, you might be familiar with the ++ syntax for incrementing a number variable by 1. In Python, we use the += in-place operator instead.

star_rating = 4
star_rating += 1
# star_rating is now 5

Other Operators
The other in-place operators work similarly:

star_rating = 4
star_rating -= 1
# star_rating is now 3

star_rating = 4
star_rating *= 2
# star_rating is now 8

star_rating = 4
star_rating /= 2
# star_rating is now 2.0

Assignment
Complete the get_hurt function. It should use the -= in-place operator to subtract damage from current_health and then return the new current_health.

You cannot use -= in a return statement. Set the variable first, and then return it after!

def get_hurt(current_health, damage):
    current_health -= damage
    return current_health
