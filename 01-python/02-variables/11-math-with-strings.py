Math With Strings
When working with strings the + operator performs a "concatenation", which is a fancy word that means "joining two strings". Generally speaking, it's better to use string interpolation with f-strings over + concatenation.

first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Wagner"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
# prints "Lane Wagner"

full_name now holds the value "Lane Wagner".

Notice the extra space at the end of "Lane " in the first_name variable. That extra space is there to separate the words in the final result: "Lane Wagner".

Assignment
We have a second player in our game!

We need to tell each of our players how much health they have left.

Edit line 9 to print You have 1200 health (Player 1's health) using string concatenation and the variables provided
Edit line 10 to print You have 1100 health (Player 2's health) in the same way

sentence_start = "You have "
sentence_end = " health"

player1_health = "1200"
player2_health = "1100"

print(sentence_start + player1_health + sentence_end)
print(sentence_start + player2_health + sentence_end)
